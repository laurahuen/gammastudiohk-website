This is the second website that I have made for my friend who is running a production company in Hong Kong:). Few things could have been done better:-
1. More repsonsive in mobile: as you see the nav bar and the boxes after mouse hover in the section of Services and the icon used in presenting Gamma Studio are pretty ugly and overthrowing, it should have been set to make it more responsive and aligned with the desktop version.
2. Colour tone more consistant with the brand colour of green & gold.
3. Exploring a set of icon that makes the brand more consistant.
4. Polishing the content of showscases where I don't have sufficient info about the company.
5. In the section of showscases - try to make the grid more scalable (e.g: few col & rows in carousell) instead of fixed pixels and lines. 

After all, I've learned the very basic concept of how css framework boostrap works to facilitate the webpage, but as of time being, I have to focus on the exploration of Javascript where it is the ulmost core and vital part of building logic for an application, and I should be growing more skills in htmp & css along the way of working on JS as an effect. So let's start with it:)
